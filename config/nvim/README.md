# DucktorDanny NeoVim config

> This repository includes all the configurations that I use.

## Details

I use the LazyNvim package manager to install and use plugins. The used plugins can be found under the `lua/ducktordanny/plugins` folder. In there most of the plugins have their own files, or in a few cases (like git) a specific area has a file with its plugins.

The other settings and remaps can be seen in the `lua/ducktordanny/core` folder.

## Notes

- For telescope to work properly, you'll need to install ripgrep ([https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)).
