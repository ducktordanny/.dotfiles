# DucktorDanny NeoVim config

> This repository includes all the configurations that I use.

## Details

I use the LazyNvim package manager to install and use plugins. The used plugins can be found under the `lua/ducktordanny/plugins` folder. In its init file there are some basic plugins and configurations, and the other ones are separated into two other files based on their purposes.

The other settings and remaps can be seen in the `lua/ducktordanny/settings.lua` file and `lua/ducktordanny/remaps` folder.

## Notes

- For telescope to work properly, you'll need to install ripgrep ([https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)).
