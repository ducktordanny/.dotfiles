# Dotfiles

> All my config files for tmux, nvim, yabai and skhd can be found here. Some of these were originally in separate repositories though I thought it would be easier to manage all of them from one single repository, so here it is.

## Old repositories

As mentioned some of the configs had separate repos, those got archived, but can be seen here:

- [NeoVim](https://github.com/ducktordanny/nvim-config)
- [tmux](https://github.com/ducktordanny/tmux-config)

## Setup

```sh
cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:ducktordanny/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
bash apply.sh
```

For more details on how to setup each of them, every tool has their own README files, check those.
